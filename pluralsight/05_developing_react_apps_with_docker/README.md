# Developing React Apps with Docker

This course is about developing React apps with Docker.

## Dockerizing a Basic React App

Original sample code can be found [here](https://github.com/saravanan75/docker_react).

Scenario:

- the company Globomantics is growing, but as it grows, it is becoming more difficult to manage the development and deployment of its applications,
- they are using (at the moment) a single monolithic application that is deployed to a single server,
- current setup is reaching its limits, and current performance metrics are barely meeting SLAs expectations,
- the company decided to hire a consultant to help them with the transition to a microservices architecture,
- part of that switch would be to use Docker to containerize the applications.

## Building a Multi-container Application Using Docker Compose

## Enhancing the Multi-container Application

## Debugging and Getting the Multi-container Application Ready for Production

Now you are ready to start developing React apps with Docker :-).
